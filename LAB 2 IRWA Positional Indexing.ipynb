And it's an honor to have everybody here. This is beyond anybody's expectations. There's been no crowd like this.And, I can tell, some of the candidates, they went in. They didn't know the air-conditioner didn't work. They sweated like dogs. [laughter]They didn't know the room was too big, because they didn't have anybody there. How are they going to beat ISIS? I don't think it's gonna happen. [applause]Our country is in serious trouble. We don't have victories anymore. We used to have victories, but we don't have them. When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the time. All the time. [applause]Audience Member: We want Trump. We want Trump.Trump: When did we beat Japan at anything? They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do? When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks. \n","\n","Remarks at the AIPAC Policy Conference in Washington, DC\n"," Good evening. Thank you very much. I speak to you today as a lifelong supporter and true friend of Israel. I'm a newcomer to politics, but not to backing the Jewish state.In 2001, weeks after the attacks on New York City and on Washington and frankly, the attacks on all of us, attacks that perpetrated and they were perpetrated by the Islamic fundamentalists, Mayor Rudy Giuliani visited Israel to show solidarity with terror victims. I sent my plane, because I backed the mission for Israel 100 percent.In spring of 2004, at the height of the violence in the Gaza Strip, I was the grand marshal of the 40th Salute to Israel parade, the largest single gathering in support of the Jewish state. It was a very dangerous time for Israel, and frankly, for anyone supporting Israel. Many people turned down this honor; I did not. I took the risk and I'm glad I did.But I didn't come here tonight to pander to you about Israel. That's what politicians do, all talk, no action, believe me. I came here to speak to you about where I stand on the future of American relations with our strategic ally, our unbreakable friendship and our cultural brother, the only democracy in the Middle East, the State of Israel.Thank you. My number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran. Thank you. I have been in business a long time, I know deal making and let me tell you, this deal is catastrophic for America, for Israel and for the whole of the Middle East.The problem here is fundamental. We've rewarded the world's leading state sponsor of terror with 150 billion dollars and we received absolutely nothing in return. I've studied this issue in great detail. I would say, actually, greater by far than anybody else, believe me, oh, believe me.And it's a bad deal. The biggest concern with the deal is not necessarily that Iran is going to violate it, because already as you know, it has. The bigger problem is that they can keep the terms and still get the bomb by simply running out the clock. \n","\n","﻿Remarks on Foreign Policy at the National Press Club in Washington,Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you, and thank you to the Center for the National Interest for honoring me with this invitation. I would like to talk today about how to develop a new foreign policy direction for our country  one that replaces randomness with purpose, ideology with strategy, and chaos with peace. It is time to shake the rust off of America's foreign policy. It's time to invite new voices and new visions into the fold. The direction I will outline today will also return us to a timeless principle. My foreign policy will always put the interests of the American people, and American security, above all else. That will be the foundation of every decision that I will make. America First will be the major and overriding theme of my administration. But to chart our path forward, we must first briefly look back. We have a lot to be proud of. In the 1940s we saved the world. The Greatest Generation beat back the Nazis and the Japanese Imperialists. Then we saved the world again, this time from totalitarian Communism. The Cold War lasted for decades, but we won. Democrats and Republicans working together got Mr. Gorbachev to heed the words of President Reagan when he said: \"tear down this wall.\" History will not forget what we did. Unfortunately, after the Cold War, our foreign policy veered badly off course. We failed to develop a new vision for a new time. In fact, as time went on, our foreign policy began to make less and less sense. Logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance, and this led to one foreign policy disaster after another. We went from mistakes in Iraq to Egypt to Libya, to President Obama's line in the sand in Syria. Each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos, and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper. It all began with the dangerous idea that we could make Western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interest in becoming a Western Democracy. We tore up what institutions they had and then were surprised at what we unleashed.\n","\n","Tokenized_sentence []\n","[]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["IR part"],"metadata":{"id":"JsBtiRR145CO"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"86s2iw8j41VH","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1664132370105,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":435,"user":{"displayName":"Sachintha Kumarasinghe","userId":"17393694132893308025"}},"outputId":"a7a3701b-f0e4-4510-9731-e79d68082b3e"},"execution_count":19,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Tokenized_sentence []\n","[]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import nltk\n","nltk.download('punkt')\n","\n","nltk.download('stopwords')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"9uL3Tb9cxaYc","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1664132265873,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":411,"user":{"displayName":"Sachintha Kumarasinghe","userId":"17393694132893308025"}},"outputId":"0ca7379e-a66e-4a60-e733-87b3a0d4f20d"},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["[nltk_data] Downloading package punkt to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package punkt is already up-to-date!\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package stopwords to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Unzipping corpora/stopwords.zip.\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["True"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":16}]}]}
